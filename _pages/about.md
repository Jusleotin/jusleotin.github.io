I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Xidian University in China. I finished my undergraduate's thesis in [WIT Lab](https://www.wit.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/) at Tohoku University under the supervision of [Prof.Dr. Noriharu Suematsu](https://www.wit.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/about/professor). I am currently a doctoral student at University at XXX under the supervision of Dr.XXX. Before studying at University at XXX, I studied on Master's program of Elctrical Engineering at TU Delft for 9 months and quitted in May 2024. I also involved in sutomotive radar signal processing algorithms development in [FusionRide](https://www.fusionride.com/) as an intern for 6 months. Now my research interests are XXX and XXX.  

Beyond Research 
======
Outside of classes and research, I typically unwind by playing basketball (I play as a shooting guard/small forward). In addition, I have a wide range of other hobbies, including cycling, go-karting, swimming, badminton, and snooker.
