I am a Ph.D. student at the University at Buffalo, advised by Dr. Rui Zhang (https://ruizhang1121.github.io/index.html). My current research focuses on **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)** and **near-field beam training/tracking**. Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Xidian University . 

Beyond Research 
======
Outside of classes and research, I typically unwind by playing basketball 🏀(I play as a shooting guard/small forward). In addition, I have a wide range of other hobbies, including cycling🚴, go-karting🏎️, swimming🏊, badminton🏸, and snooker🎱.
