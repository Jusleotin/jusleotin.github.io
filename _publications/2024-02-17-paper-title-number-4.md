**Abstract:** 
The traditional Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) system is a remote sensing system designed for static targets on the ground. When there is a Doppler mismatch caused by target motion, it will blur and offset the pixel. SAR-GMTI is a synthetic aperture radar system that can indicate, locate and indicate moving targets on the ground. And it makes a positive difference in counter-terrorism activities, refugee control, anti-smuggling at sea, and traffic control in the cities. There are two mainstream dual-channel SAR-GMTI technologies, one is Displaced Phase Center Antenna(DPCA) and another is Along Track Interferometry(ATI). SAR-GMTI based on DPCA can be applied to detect and track maneuvering tactical targets from complex scenes on the ground, which has great strategic value. This paper initially takes a T-72 tank from MSTAR Dataset as the simulation target and analyzes the influence of radial velocity and transverse velocity on imaging. Then DPCA technique is used to detect the moving target in strong clutter. The conclusions of the experiment show that DPCA can detect targets effectively in strong clutter, which provides theoretical support for the engineering application of ground-moving target indication.
